      <div class='description'>
        <p>PICTURE HOUSE is Singapore's leading cinema exhibitor with 5 multiplexes, housing 5 screens, located at Nex, Junction 8, Jurong Point, Tampines Mall & Plaza Singapura.</p>

        <p>In June 2018, Picture House expanded its footprint into the heartlands of Serangoon, a densely populated north-east zone of Singapore. The 50-seater cinema, features all leatherette seats designed for ultimate comfort and style. </p>

        <p>Picture House was established to develop and operate modern, luxurious multiplex cinemas and is the first local cinema company to personalise the movie-going experience through its movie booking program. A prime mover in the introduction of the multiplex to Asia, Picture House’s first imprint in Singapore was made on 28 May 1992 with the successful opening of Plaza Singapura cinema complex. Today, Picture House has a reputation of offering the widest choice of movies, state-of-the-art design, convenience and unparalleled comfort, with all cinemas newly refurbished between 2010 to 2016.</p>

        <p>Established in 1993, Picture House is Singapore's leading independent film distributor, releasing a wide range of blockbusters from the JOHN WICK series, KING ARTHUR: LEGEND OF THE SWORD and SULLY, to Asian delights that include Jackie Chan’s classic action-comedy KUNG FU YOGA, and TRAIN TO BUSAN and THE BATTLESHIP ISLAND, the latter two shedding new light on Korean movies by crossing the million-dollar marks in their box offices. Picture House is also the top distributor for home-grown films including the AH BOYS TO MEN series and the award-winning APPRENTICE.</p>
